# Colour Palette

I am new to UI/UX design and I have no idea what I'm doing.
Colour is possibly my weakest area.

From <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIuVvCuiJhU">my research</a>
I think I need to find:
- Background colour,
- Text colour,
- Primary colour,
- Secondary colour,
- Accent colour.

I used <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a> to generate a palette and
<a href="https://www.realtimecolors.com/">Realtime Colors</a> to see how
it might look.  
This is what I came up with:

I'm not 100% sure it's going to work but I am going to  
a. trust the process,  
b. use constants so that I can easily change the whole theme later.
