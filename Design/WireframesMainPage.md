# Wireframes
The main page should be scrollable and have several different sections
that give a good overview of me. Where applicable, the sections should
link to other pages with more detail. e.g. The Education section on the
main page might list a few notable university modules, but the dedicated
Education page will have every module with a description, and entries
for further back in my education history.
